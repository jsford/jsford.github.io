  abstract: I don't know. I guess I have a lot of thoughts.

When I was young, I read a lot.
I found over time that I could remember which books I owned, what shelf they were on, etc. for hundreds of books.
I never intentionally memorized which books we owned.

Now, I wander through lowe's, home depot, michaels, tractor supply, JOANN, etc. to build my mental inventory.
I trawl through mcmaster, hobbyking, amazon, whatever too.
I have memorized the contents of the scrap pile at cmu. I check in occasionally to stay up to date.
I know what tools I own and where I keep them. I know what parts I have squirrelled away in bins.
If I want to build something, I want to know what parts are available to me, at what cost, and with what delay.
Therefore, I build and maintain this mental parts library.

## More thoughts

Just like with books, I don't do this intentionally. But there are benefits that I have noticed.
Indexing the world can be inspiring. What if I buy this stainless steel bowl and bolt that welding magnet I keep under my desk to it? I could put it in the garage gym and use it to hold my chalk.

## What else?

Indexing the world is fun --- I want to shape the world around me, so it helps to know what is in the world around me.
If I were stranded in a lifeboat, I would find and list my resources. I'm not trapped in a life boat, but I find it useful just the same.

Indexing the world is a way of seeing. Sometimes a screwdriver is a tool for turning screws. Sometimes it's raw material that I can heat and bend into a hook that is perfect for opening unergonomic connectors.
